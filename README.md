# MMDalgorithmImplementation3Bit
This program implements one of the mostly common used transformation based systhesis algorithm in reversible computing for 3 
reversible conservative functions.
This algorithm is known as MMD algorithm.
This program reads all the conservative reversible functions from files and apply transformation based systhesis algorithm.
After applying the algorithm this program stores the "Gate Count" and "Quantum Cost" in files for further processing.
